    <h2>My bio section</h2>

    <p>
      Hello everybody, my name is Kyle. I'm 35, yes that means I'm an 80's kid <strong>deal with it.</strong> I was a military brat, I joined the Army straight out of high school as well. I've lived all over the world and had <mark> many, MANY adventures.</mark> I was a crewchief on Chinooks <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_CH-47_Chinook">a</a></sup> for the first five years of my career, then I worked for <del>Military Intellegence</del><sub>(such a thing does not exist)</sub> for the second half.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p> After the military I came back home to Knoxville, TN and took on work doing heavy aircraft maintenance for <a href="https://www.expressjet.com/"><i>ExpressJet Airlines</i></a>. Covid caused the business to downsize, our entire hangar was closed down. <b>Very few airlines are hiring,</b> and I believe software engineering & data science are the future of first-world economies.
